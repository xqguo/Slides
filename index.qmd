- Payout Type: call, put, exotic

- Settlement Type: cash settled, delivery

- Exercise Time: European, American, Bermudan 

# Pricing

How to determine option value?

## Option Specs

In order to understand options pricing, we need to look at the following factors:

1. Strike price
    - The specified price at which the underlying asset can be bought or sold

2. Time to expiration
    - The amount of time remaining until the option expires

## Market data

1. Price of the underlying asset

2. Volatility of the underlying asset
    - How much the price of the underlying asset is expected to fluctuate

These factors are used to calculate the theoretical value of an option using a mathematical model such as the Black-Scholes model. However, the actual price of an option may also be influenced by supply and demand in the market.

# Call Option Price Charts

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import norm
import plotly.express as px

# Define the parameters for the call option
S = 100     # current underlying price
K = 100     # option strike price
r = 0.0    # risk-free interest rate
T = 1       # time to maturity (in years)

# Define a range of underlying prices to plot
S_range = np.linspace(1, 200, 100)

# Define two different volatilities to plot
sigma1 = 0.01
sigma2 = 0.3

# Calculate the call option prices for each underlying price and volatility
d1_1 = (np.log(S_range/K) + (r + 0.5*sigma1**2)*T) / (sigma1*np.sqrt(T))
d2_1 = d1_1 - sigma1*np.sqrt(T)
call_price_1 = S_range*norm.cdf(d1_1) - K*np.exp(-r*T)*norm.cdf(d2_1)

d1_2 = (np.log(S_range/K) + (r + 0.5*sigma2**2)*T) / (sigma2*np.sqrt(T))
d2_2 = d1_2 - sigma2*np.sqrt(T)
call_price_2 = S_range*norm.cdf(d1_2) - K*np.exp(-r*T)*norm.cdf(d2_2)

# Combine the data into a Pandas DataFrame
data = np.column_stack((S_range, call_price_1, call_price_2))
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=[
                  "Underlying Price", f"Volatility = {sigma1:.2%}", f"Volatility = {sigma2:.2%}"])

# Melt the DataFrame to create the long-form data required by Plotly Express
df_melted = df.melt(id_vars=["Underlying Price"],
                    var_name="Volatility", value_name="Call Option Price")

# Create the Plotly Express figure

## Put Option Price Charts

```{python}
# Calculate the call option prices for each underlying price and volatility
d1_1 = (np.log(S_range/K) + (r + 0.5*sigma1**2)*T) / (sigma1*np.sqrt(T))
d2_1 = d1_1 - sigma1*np.sqrt(T)
price_1 = -S_range*norm.cdf(-d1_1) + K*np.exp(-r*T)*norm.cdf(-d2_1)

d1_2 = (np.log(S_range/K) + (r + 0.5*sigma2**2)*T) / (sigma2*np.sqrt(T))
d2_2 = d1_2 - sigma2*np.sqrt(T)
price_2 = -S_range*norm.cdf(-d1_2) + K*np.exp(-r*T)*norm.cdf(-d2_2)

# Combine the data into a Pandas DataFrame

df_melted = df.melt(id_vars=["Underlying Price"],
                    var_name="Volatility", value_name="Put Option Price")
