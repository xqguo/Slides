<h1>Definition</h1>
<p>Options are financial derivatives that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified price on or before a specified date.</p>

<h2>Types of Options</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Underlying type: futures options, futures spread options, equity options, fx options, interest rate options</p></li>
<li><p>Payout Type: call, put, exotic</p></li>
<li><p>Settlement Type: cash settled, delivery</p></li>

<p>How to determine option value?</p>
</section>
<section id="option-specs" class="slide level2">
<h2>Option Specs</h2>
<p>In order to understand options pricing, we need to look at the following factors:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Strike price
<ul>
<li>The specified price at which the underlying asset can be bought or sold</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Time to expiration
<ul>
<li>The amount of time remaining until the option expires</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="market-data" class="slide level2">
<h2>Market data</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Price of the underlying asset</p></li>
<li><p>Volatility of the underlying asset</p>
<ul>
<li>How much the price of the underlying asset is expected to fluctuate</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>These factors are used to calculate the theoretical value of an option using a mathematical model such as the Black-Scholes model. However, the actual price of an option may also be influenced by supply and demand in the market.</p>
